# Access, Encapsulation, and Scope
---

## Review

Nice work! In this lesson, we dove into some of the more subtle features of 


 
Here are some of the main takeaways from this lesson:

The public and private keywords are used to define what parts of code have access to other classes, 

Encapsulation is a technique used to keep implementation details hidden from other classes. Its aim is to create small bundles of logic.

The this keyword can be used to designate the difference between instance variables and local variables.

Local variables can only be used within the scope that they were defined in.

The this keyword can be used to call methods when writing classes.

## Static

Great work! You now have an understanding of what the static keyword does. In fact, if you’ve made it this far in your Java lessons, you probably have a pretty good sense of what all the keywords and jargon are doing in public static void main(String[] args). Take a moment to celebrate — that line of code can be incredibly intimidating for new learners and it’s a real accomplishment to learn about all of those different pieces.

To review, here are some of the main takeaways about static 


Static are associated with the class as a whole, not objects of the class.

Static methods and variables are declared as static by using the static keyword upon declaration.

Static methods cannot interact with non-static instance variables. This is due to static methods not having a this reference.

Both static methods and non-static methods can interact with static variables.
